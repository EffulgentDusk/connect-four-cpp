# About
A game of Connect Four created in C++ with Allegro, implementing an AI based on simple [Minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) and [Minimax with Alpha-beta pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphaâ€“beta_pruning).  

This game was created by [Loukmane Maada](https://github.com/loding1397), [Soukaina Moumou](https://github.com/SoukaM) and [Anas Limouri](https://github.com/EffulgentDusk).  

Some sounds used in the game are originally made by [Chris Kempson](https://github.com/chriskempson) and implemented in his [Connect four version](https://github.com/chriskempson/cpp-connect-four), registered with an MIT License.
